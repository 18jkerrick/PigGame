The pig game is a simple two player game. The game begins when the first player rolls the dice. The number that they role is added to their score. The 
player can then choose to roll again in order to increase their score or hold and pass the turn to player 2. If player 1 chooses to roll and they roll a 1, their score is wiped and it is now player 2's turn. The game is won when somebody gets to a score of 50 or higher. 

I used HTML and CSS for the front-end and Javascript for the backend logic.
